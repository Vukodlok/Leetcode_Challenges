/*
* Leetcode Challenge: Find Peak Element 
*
* A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
* Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, 
* and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, 
* return the index to any of the peaks.
*
* You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, 
* an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a 
* neighbor that is outside the array.
*
* You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
