# Leetcode_Challenges
A collection of my attempts and solutions for the challenges on Leetcode.com. Below is an alphabetical list of those I've completed
and a quick description of the problem for my own use in finding an algorithm later.

- Add Binary: Sum two binary strings.
- Happy Number: Replace an integer by the sum of the squares of its digits. Repeat until the result is 1 or an infinite loop.
- Length of Last Word: Find the length of the last word in a string.
- Merge Sorted Array: Merge two sorted arrays back into the first array sorted.
- Number of 1 Bits: Find the number os set bits(1's) in a binary number.
- Palindrome Number: Check if a number is a palindrome (same forwards and backwards).
- Ransom Note: Determine if all characters in a string are contained within another string.
- Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array: Remove all duplicate values from a sorted array.
- Remove Element: Remove all occurrences of a value from an array.
- Reverse Bits: Reverse a binary number (the order, not flipping the bits).
- Roman to Integer: Convert a roman numeral to an integer.
- Same Tree: Check if two binary trees have the same structure and node values.
- Sqrt(x): Approximate the square root of a number, rounded down to the nearest integer.
- Symmetric Tree: Check if a binary tree is a mirror of itself (left and right sides match).
- Valid Palindrome: Determine if a string is a palindrome (same backwards and forwards).
