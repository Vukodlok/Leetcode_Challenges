- Count Complete Tree Nodes: Count the number of nodes in a binary tree.
- Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String - Find the index of a substring within another string.
- Happy Number: Replace an integer by the sum of the squares of its digits. Repeat until the result is 1 or an infinite loop.
- H-Index: Given an array find the h-index, max value s.t. at least h values are h or greater.
- Insert Delete GetRandom O(1): Implement a class with an insert element, remove element, and return random element functionality.
